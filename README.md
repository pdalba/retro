Refraction in Exoplanet Transit Observations

RETrO is a useful tool to simulate atmospheric refraction phenomena in the atmospheres of transiting and non-transiting exoplaents. RETrO is written in Python and described in an article currently submitted to AAS Journals (Dalba, submitted).

I will upload the code that comprises RETrO. In the meantime, please contact me with any questions.
